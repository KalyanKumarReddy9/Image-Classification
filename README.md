**implementation of using a pre-trained VGG-16 model as a feature extractor for image classification with SVM (Support Vector Machine)**. It covers:

Data loading and preprocessing with PyTorch DataLoader and transforms

Feature extraction using the VGG-16 model (removing classifier layers)

Training and evaluation of an SVM classifier using scikit-learn

Performance reporting via classification reports and confusion matrices
